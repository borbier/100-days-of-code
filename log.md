# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've reviewed some of React concepts and build some of small snippets such as components, props, parsing state and props through components, functional components and basic hooks.(~70 mins)

**Thoughts** I've written some of React before but I didn't really get to the concept really much at that time so I start my first day with reviewing React.

**Link(s) to stuffs I learned**
1. [React Docs -- Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
2. [Prongbang blog -- I found it easy to understand for Thais](https://prongbang.github.io/category/react)
