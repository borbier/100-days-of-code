# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've reviewed some of React concepts and build some of small snippets such as components, props, parsing state and props through components, functional components and basic hooks.(~70 mins)

**Thoughts** I've written some of React before but I didn't really get to the concept really much at that time so I start my first day with reviewing React.

### Day 2: May 22, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've reviewed a bit further about React concepts such as Redux and a bit of inline-styling.(~60 mins)

**Thoughts** Redux is a concept that I admitted that it is pretty hard for me to understand. I spent my time on understanding it mechanism and structure. I want to do some small project that use Redux or MobX.

### Day 3: May 24, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've practiced some coding problems in LeetCode(~60 mins) and also getting started in studying some database from Stanford lecture that I've found in youtube.(~30 mins)

**Thoughts** I'm thinking of reviewing concepts about algorithms for a while. I also have implemented some of backend that required database modeling and querying but I haven't studied about theory yet. It is good day for starting in reviewing and studying it deeper.

### Day 4: May 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've tried using Typescript and also applied with Express (~80 mins) and do some problems in LeetCode.(~40 mins)

**Thoughts** I found really less resources about using Typescript in Node.js or some modules e.g. Sequelize. I'm thinking of applying with it.
